# How a trade war will whack U.S. car, aircraft exports to China

[ Article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/04/04/us-china-exports-tariffs-trade-war/485006002)

This particular article covering the back and forth between President Donald Trump and China breaks down in mostly dollars how 
tariffs on goods will impact the US economy. 

The article is heavily on the side of numbers and it could be a difficult article to dissect. For the typical reader I would 
imagine that although the data may be accurate in its merit, it could turn away readers. 

It begins with numbers after the nut graph, and hits the reader with large numbers. Granted they are rounded, the prospect of reading the word billion in comparasion with another large number is not reader friendly. 

Another aspect of this data story that makes it harder for the general user to read is throwing in percentages in the midst of dollar figures. 

With a story like this in a listed form outlining key U.S. products sold to China and the annual value of those shipments, as
pointed out in the article, what would make it more appealing would be graphics and charts to invite me in as a reader. 

While on the face it is a very simplistic article supported by a list that is simple to read, the multimedia aspect of it is lacking. 

Their data was in a list form similar to this: 

1. Soybeans: $14.204 billion

2. Aircraft, spacecraft and related parts: $13.2 billion

3. Autos: $8 billion

4. Medical devices: $6.646 billion

5. Semiconductors and components: $6 billion

What this data story does really well is link to other data which has been gather that expands on the current list of  
products. 


They linked to articles from previous storues their working on their website. I am also still wondering why I should care
about this story. It may simple be because I am generally informed on American politics but it was not a breaking story.
