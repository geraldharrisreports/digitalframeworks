Dear Rachel, 

With the new transit referendum being voted on May 1st, I am doing an comparative analysis on traffic accidents 10 and 20 years before 2018. I will also compare that two the rate in which Nashville’s population grew. This would be tied in with how has the increase of people in the city effected the number of crashes. I will also look at data that looks at vehicular crashes prior to Metro Transit, and again after. 

I found reliable data on Data.Nashville.gov, that outlines year by year the number of traffic crashes, and breaks it down into. 

	Accident Number
	Date and Time
	Number of Motor Vehicles 
	Number of Injuries
	Number of Fatalities 
	Property Damage 	
	Hit and Runs 

I am able to contact the data set owner, which would be an administrator for the Metro Nashville Police Department. 

The Liscience is also publically displayed through https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/  (there is not a political relationship). 

As for as the rows and columns it is 610-R and 25-Columns. This is a very trustworthy site and data because of the updates they have provided. I am able to contact the owner. It was last updated April, 11 2018 which means the data is constantly being added and updated to reflect the latest numbers. 

Here is the link to the set of Data I will begin my research with 
https://data.nashville.gov/Police/Metro-Nashville-Davidson-County-Traffic-Crashes-20/8kay-6qhc


Although with those numbers being updated , I may have to use data sets from 2017, which is also accessible through Data.Nashville.gov and could be found here https://data.nashville.gov/Police/Metro-Nashville-Davidson-County-Traffic-Crashes-20/v6ss-vxgd 

 And use the data that is stuck and stone and won’t move and be updated everyday. 

Best,
