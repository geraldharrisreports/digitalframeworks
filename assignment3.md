The first year of a presidential adminiatraion is an important one in laying down the groundwork for their policies. 
One of the biggest indicators in determining how a presidencey will go is to look at their relationship with foreign leaders.
I looked at the first 10 trips aboard for President Barack Obama and the first 10 for President Donald Trump. 

I looked at which president, date of arrival, reason for the trip, place, and time spent there. There were a number of stories 
I could gather from this data set. 

1. How unusual or usual it is for the newly elected President to visit either Canada or Mexico as their first trip as Commander in Chief.
2. Is it unusual to not visit a war zone for the American President in the first year of their presidency? 
3. How effective were the trips and which President had the biggest impact?
