The use of public safety resources such as Fire, Police and EMT are costly. There are often radio and television ads that 
suggest that only when real emergencies present itself should a member of the public contact emergency services for their 
help. With a viral video of an Oakland woman calling police on a group of mostly minorities in a designated gas-barbecuing 
area, begged the question of how many times do police receive a call that result in arrest, or citation. The conversation has 
persisted on social media sites. While the data sets do not give specific circumstances for the calls, they broadly define why 
the call was made. While the answer could be found for specific instances in looking up police reports and statements, it 
would be a long and tedious process. 

Using the city of Nashville there seem to be imbalance when it comes to arrest or citation. This year alone Nashville has seen 
over 17 million calls for service only point one percent resulted in those penalties. The data collected from the city of 
Nashville collected thousands of police calls made from January of 2018 until May of 2018. This is used to pinpoint what calls 
are being made and what response is being taking in reaction to the call. 

The graphic shown is a bar chart used to illustrate how many calls per subject areas there are. This is used visually to 
compel the reader to see how each call stack up against one another. More importantly it gives clear evidence to support the 
research being done. Looking at the data set is important to notice the variant degrees in which police are called. While the 
data set does not include severity of each call, it is important to be mindful that police must respond to all service 911 c
alls.
